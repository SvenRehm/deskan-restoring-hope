               <p>
                  “I am a cancer patient and at one time I just finish CHEM and
                  got started late trying to get things for my children to have
                  a Thanksgiving meal. It was so hard, I got frustrated,
                  depressed and felt at my wits end. Everything was so hard.”
                  However, thanks to Deskan, my children were able to eat a nice
                  meal for Thanksgiving.” (Bufford, GA).

               <p>
                  These 5 children did not ask to come here. The situation is
                  very bad with their parents. They fight all the time. I am in
                  church on my knees that the Lord would help. This food would
                  help so much. The toys would keep the children happy. God
                  bless you people.” (Grandmother of 2).
