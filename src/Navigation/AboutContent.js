      paragraph: `<li>“I am a cancer patient I just finish CHEM and get started late just trying to get things for my children to have a Thanksgiving meal. Ms you do not know. It is so hard. Sometimes I just feel like I am not fit to be a mother. Everything is so hard.” My Children will be able to eat a nice meal tomorrow.” (Bufford, GA) 
      </li>
      <li>
      “I lost my job in October 2011; ever since things have been rough. My car broke down--had to get a new car, which I did not want because now I have a payment and things got really bad. I have a job now, but it does not pay as much as I am always behind. I am also behind in my mortgage. I have legal trouble with my 9-year-old son, that is an expense. You people save the day with the food. I just cannot put food on the table for Thanksgiving. Please pray for us.” 
      </li>
      <li>
      “I am a grandmother trying to raise my grandchildren. These 5 children did not ask to come here. The situation is very bad with their parents. They fight all the time. I am in church on my knees that the Lord would help. This food would help so much. The toys would keep the children happy. God bless you people.” “It has been a hard year and I am currently in Bankruptcy.” (Mother of 2)

      “Because I am a single mother taking care of 7 kids on my own. I am working, but it is just enough to pay the rent and other bills. I did not have any money to buy them Christmas toys.” (Scottsdale GA) “I am a single mother of three from Tennessee…My son’s father was murdered in front of us. I am a Christian, I grew up in a Christian home, but things got a little out of hand. I just had to ask for help. My son is constantly in fights in school. The teachers do not understand. I have to move from city to city to save our life. I live from place to place, but I have to get them in school. I need help. I tried so many times to take my life, but then I look at my children.” (Decatur) 
      </li>
      <li>
      “I am a single mother of two wonderful children and am unable to provide them with Thanksgiving or Christmas this year. My heart is breaking for them at this difficult time in our lives. Recently I lost my job, and cannot make ends meet. I am continuously looking for a job, but with the holidays just around the corner, I am scared. Please help me to find the resources I need to make the holidays a happy time for them. My daughter Tristan is 8 years old, and my son Samuel is 7 years old. I will do anything to see their faces light up throughout the holidays. If you have a job I can do, I will do whatever it takes. May you guys be blessed.

      I am a 65-year-old male. My wife and I have not had any food for a couple of days. You see, by the time my Social Security check comes, I am already broke. We get $731.00 a month to pay rent, light bill, clothing, and food. I used to be able to get some handyman work, but not anymore. No one understands this!! 
      </li>
      I am the mother of five children. I lost my job since last year and I have not been able to find work as yet. Some months are harder than some. The State has granted me food stamps for food. Not some items like toilet paper, clothing, and medicine. I am sick, my kids are sick. I get some help sometimes from agencies but not all the time. I have a handicapped 2-year-old child. 
      <li>
      I am a mother of two children, a 10-year-old and an 18-month-old girl that was born weighing one and one-half pounds. She is still being monitored by the hospital. So I can not work. My husband walked away after she was born. My mother helps when she can. I just need to have a meal for Thanksgiving. My daughter is helping me to adjust many days and nights. </li>
